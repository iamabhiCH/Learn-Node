/*
    You are organizing a party and want to track the list of guest. Create an array called
    "guestList" and add the names of at least five guest. Then, WAP that checks if a given 
    name is in the list or not? If  it is present then print “Welcome to the party ["name"]",
    otherwise print “Sorry ["Name] is not invited”.
